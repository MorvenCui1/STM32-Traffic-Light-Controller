# STM32-Traffic-Light-Controller
Firmware written in C for a traffic light controller using a STM32L476RG microcontroller. Used two methods to implement it. First was a task scheduler to blink LEDs using FreeRTOS. Second was using a timer and interrupt handler. Used UART to transmit debug messages.
